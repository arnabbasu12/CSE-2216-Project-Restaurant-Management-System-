# CSE-3201-Project-Restaurant-Management-System-
SD-1 Project
A simple Python console program to take restaurant orders and generate a bill.
In this project, we have developed a simple text-based restaurant ordering system using the
Python programming language. The main objective of this system is to simulate a basic menudriven order-taking process, which is commonly used in restaurants or cafes. This program
allows customers to view the menu, place orders by choosing items and their quantities, and
finally view the total bill for their selected items.
## Features
- Display menu with prices.
- Take multiple orders.
- Calculate total bill.
- Handle invalid inputs.

## Menu
Pizza: 70 TK | Pasta: 50 TK | Burger: 30 TK | Salad: 30 TK | Coffee: 60 TK | Fries: 20 TK | Kabab: 60 TK

## Usage
1. Run the script:
python Project.py
Enter the item and quantity when prompted.

Type No when finished to see your bill.

Example
Enter item: Pizza
Quantity: 2
Add more? Yes
Enter item: Coffee
Quantity: 1
Add more? No

Bill:
Pizza x 2 = 140 TK
Coffee x 1 = 60 TK
Total: 200 TK

Requirements
Python 3.x
